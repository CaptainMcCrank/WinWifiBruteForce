# WinWifiBruteForce
A powershell script for bruteforcing the credential of a wifi network

This script expects a passwords.txt file in the working directory of the script.  

I leave it as an exercise for the reader to locate their own passwords lists, but I've included a sample dummy file with a limited number of passwords

# Running the Brute Forcer
```
./WinWifiBruteForcer.ps1
```

you can launch powershell in windows by clicking on the Search Icon and typing "powershell"

You could copy and paste these files in your system, or you could:
